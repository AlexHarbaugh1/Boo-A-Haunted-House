This is the project for our CS 221 class! It is a text based dugneon crawling game that features some random number generated features, from choosing weapon type to hit points, etc. 
It was developed using Java Netbeans for everything, including the GUI interfaces.

Every branch was contributed to by each member, no one person would usually tackle anything on their own. 

The main function to build and run the game is "TheDungeon" and is where most of the game logic lies.
